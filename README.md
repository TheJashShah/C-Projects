# C-Projects
 All of my projects in C, upto date.

# Individual Files
These were made while I was still learning the language.

# Inventory-System
This was made to conclude the learning part, and make myself sure that structs are not my enemy.

# Tic-tac-Toe
This marks the end of me being a beginner in C. (I still dont fucking understand pointers.)
