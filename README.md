# C-Projects
 All of my projects in C, upto date.

# Individual Files
 These were made while I was still learning the language.

# Blackjack
 A simple blackjack single-player game having only the player and the dealer.

# Inventory-System
 This was made to conclude the learning part, and make myself sure that structs are not my enemy.

# Sudoku
 A console basec Sudoku game, with options to either play the game, or let the computer solve it. Board is loaded using a .txt file, and to solve the game, Recursive Backtracking is used.

# Tic-tac-Toe
 This marks the end of me being a beginner in C. (I still dont fucking understand pointers.)

# To-Do-App
 A To-Do-List app in C, where you can add, update and delete tasks. The tasks are sorted by priority given by the user. A write and read system is implemented to save the list.
